Version 1.0.4 re-release (2019-06-29):
=======================================================================

* Added `CONTRIBUTORS.txt'.
* WinQuake is listed as a supported game in `games.html'.
* The binaries in this release are identical to the
  original ipxemu 1.0.4 release.

Version 1.0.4 (2014-08-22):
=======================================================================

* Updated the Warcraft II BNE bugfix so it can patch (and restore) both
  version 2.0.2.0 and 2.0.2.1 of "Warcraft II BNE.exe".
* For emulated sockets, set the socket family to AF_IPX in
  wsock32.dll's recvfrom() (it was incorrectly set to NSPROTO_IPX
  before).

Version 1.0.3 (2014-04-27):
=======================================================================

* Updated the `Problems and workarounds' section for `Yuri's Revenge'
  in 'games.html'.
* Changed the FILETYPE in the VERSIONINFO of the
  win_9x-nt4_dpwsockx_patch to VFT_APP (from VFT_DLL).
* Added a demo screenshot to both the SourceForge project page and web
  page.

Version 1.0.2 (2012-07-14):
=======================================================================

* Made it less probable for two instances of `thipx32.dll' to use the
  same broadcast signature.
* Added a tool with which one can apply a bugfix to
  `Warcraft II BNE.exe', to solve the `Waiting for response' problem.
  See `tools\warcraft_2_bne_bugfix\README.txt' for more information.
* Documented (in the `games.html' document) that Red Alert 1 needs to
  run in Windows 95 compatibility mode for the `Network' option to
  appear in the `Multiplayer Game' menu.
* Changed the license to the Fair License.

Version 1.0.1 (2012-01-10):
=======================================================================

* Added more debugging output to the debug version of `wsock32.dll'
  (found in ipxemu-debug-xxx.zip). It will now log the IP address and
  port for incoming and outgoing fragments of data. (Remember, the
  `wsock32-log.txt' file can be found in the temporary directory,
  %TMP%, which on Windows 7 is usually equal to
  `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp'.)

Version 1.0.0 (2011-06-25):
=======================================================================

* First release.
