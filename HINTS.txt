Internet play
=======================================================================

To play games over the internet using ipxemu, one may consider usage of
a VPN (Virtual Private Network) server such as tinc
(http://tinc-vpn.org/). This way, the games can communicate with each
other as if they were on a LAN (Local Area Network).
